IF choice A is selected

You quickly type out a message, your fingers dancing across the alien device's keypad. "Hey there, hang in tight! I'm here to help. Can you share more about the crash? Any landmarks or signs to help narrow down your location?" The astronaut's reply floods in, describing a bizarre landscape with towering crystalline structures and bioluminescent flora. With this newfound information, you face your first crucial decision:

Navigate the Terrain:
Option A: Suggest the astronaut head towards the crystalline structures, as they might be visible from space and act as a potential beacon for rescue.
Option B: Advise the astronaut to stay put and conserve resources until further instructions, avoiding unnecessary movement in the unfamiliar terrain.
Option C: Propose exploring the bioluminescent flora, as it could lead to resources or shelter, potentially increasing chances of survival.


IF Choice B is Selected 

You raise an eyebrow, wondering if this could be some elaborate prank or a malfunction in the alien communication device. "Hold on a sec. How do I know you're not just messing with me or if this is some glitch? Give me something to prove you're legit," you type, still not fully convinced.

A few tense moments pass before the astronaut responds with a distressing image, showing the damaged spacecraft against the alien landscape. The undeniable authenticity of the image prompts a sense of urgency. Now faced with a more pressing choice:

Decide on Immediate Action:
Option A: Apologize for doubting and dive into full assistance mode, offering guidance on initial survival steps.
Option B: Ask for more specific details about the crash to assess the severity and potential risks before deciding the next course of action.
Option C: Share your location details and ask the astronaut to provide any recognizable features that could help in coordinating a rescue effort.

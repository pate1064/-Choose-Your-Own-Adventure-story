IF choice A is selected

You quickly type out a message, your fingers dancing across the alien device's keypad. "Hey there, hang in tight! I'm here to help. Can you share more about the crash? Any landmarks or signs to help narrow down your location?" The astronaut's reply floods in, describing a bizarre landscape with towering crystalline structures and bioluminescent flora. With this newfound information, you face your first crucial decision:

Navigate the Terrain:
Option A: Suggest the astronaut head towards the crystalline structures, as they might be visible from space and act as a potential beacon for rescue.
Option B: Advise the astronaut to stay put and conserve resources until further instructions, avoiding unnecessary movement in the unfamiliar terrain.
Option C: Propose exploring the bioluminescent flora, as it could lead to resources or shelter, potentially increasing chances of survival.
